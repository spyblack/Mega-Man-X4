Patch Variants
========================================================================================

UNDUB:

	The original version of the project. Doesn't include any changes to script or font.

	Video subtitles based on Hondoori's translation. Made specifically for the PS1 version
	(320x240), so the font size and style is optimized for a low resolution.


UNDUB + RETRANSLATION:

	Includes the script from NectarHime's relocalization of the PC version (Final Weaponproject)
	Additional tweaks to font and text spacing (variable font width) are exclusive to this release.

	Instead of the videos from the Final Weapon projects, it uses the videos from the
	original Undub version, as they're are optimized for the PS1 version.

Additional Hacks
========================================================================================

This project doesn't make any adjustment to gameplay, but some smaller tweaks could
be added gere in the form of hex edits.

If you've never replaced hexadecimal data in a file before, here's some basic instructions:

1. 	Download: 	HxD (https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
				EDC/ECC recalculator (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1264/)
2. 	After patching, open the modified BIN in HxD
3. 	Press "Ctrl+G" to jump to an address. Use "hex" mode, set offset relative to "begin".
	Paste the addresses listed, and you should find the original values I'm providing.
4. 	Paste the modified hex data with "Ctrl+B" (while Ctrl+V is a "add-paste", Ctrl+B
	is a "overwrite-paste"). Make sure the hexadecimal side of the window is selected
	(the middle column), and the pointer is at the correct address (check the status bar
	at the bottom).
5. 	Repeat 3 and 4 for all the changes you want to make.
6. 	Save and exit.
7. 	Run the modified BIN through the EDC/ECC recalculator. This step is not necessary
	for certain emulators, but it is to play on original hardware and on the more
	accurate emulators.
	
When there's multiple entries listed, you need to modify all of them for the change to
work correctly.

Also note that these addresses will not match an unmodified Mega Man X4 BIN.
